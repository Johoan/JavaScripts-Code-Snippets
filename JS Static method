// In Static Method there is no instantiation of class and so no need for a Constructor
// You don't need to add a constructor to your class, as you are not going to instantiate it. You have a method which:

// Prints a generic message.

// Accepts an argument and uses it to generate a message.

// Returns a value based on the arguments you send it.

// All of these different functionalities could be left to functions â€” the advantage of using static class methods is to group them by category or type, for example.

class BePolite {
    static sayHello() {
        console.log('Hello!');
    }
    static sayHelloTo(name) {
        console.log('Hello ' + name + '!');
    }
    static add(firstNumber, secondNumber) {
        return firstNumber + secondNumber;
    }
}

BePolite.sayHello(); // prints 'Hello!'
BePolite.sayHelloTo('Will'); // prints 'Hello Will!'
const sum = BePolite.add(2, 3); // sum = 5
