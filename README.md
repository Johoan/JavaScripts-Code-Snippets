# JavaScripts-Code-Snippets - Static Method
# In Static Method there is no instantiation of class and so no need for a Constructor
# You don't need to add a constructor to your class, as you are not going to instantiate it. You have a method which:

# Prints a generic message.

# Accepts an argument and uses it to generate a message.

# Returns a value based on the arguments you send it.

# All of these different functionalities could be left to functions â€” the advantage of using static class methods is to group them by category or type, for example.
